![VI with Cable](/images/vi-raw.jpg)

The current implementation uses the [Digilent chipKIT Max32][chipkit], an
[Arduino-compatible][arduino] microcontroller based on PIC32. The [Network
Shield][] add-on adds two CAN transceivers, which is enough to enable most
OpenXC applications.

The translator is powered via its micro-USB port, which is connected to the host
device. CAN messages are received via the OBD-II port in the driver's footwell.

If you want **wireless** support, we have documentation and an extended parts
list for [adding a Bluetooth module](/bluetooth/hardware.html).

## Parts List

This is a list of the hardware used in the reference OpenXC kit - you're
guaranteed to have a 100% compatible OpenXC device if you use these parts
exactly. There are many equally compatible variations on this list from hundreds
of different vendors, so feel free to use other parts you may have on hand (like
the crimp connectors, for example).

* Digilent chipKIT Max32 Microcontroller from [Digilent][max32] ($50)
* Digilent chipKIT Network Shield from [Digilent][Network Shield] ($55)
* OBD-II Male to Breakout Cable from [OBD2Cables][obd2cable] ($13)
* (3x) 2x6 Crimp Connector Housings from [Pololu][crimpconnectors] (< $1)
* (7x) Female crimp pins from [Pololu][crimppins] (< $1)
* (1x) Male crimp pin from [Pololu][crimppinsmale] (< $1)
* Shrink tubing
* Rubber cable grommet that fits the OBD-II cable
* Optional - Enclosure from [PacTec][enclosure] ($11)
* Optional - Mounting spacers for use with the enclosure

## Tools List

This is a list of the tools needed to assemble the kit.

* Wire stripper
* Wire crimper
* Heat gun (or lighter)
* Multimeter for continuity testing
* Optional - label maker

For the suggested enclosure, you'll also need the following:

* Angle cutters
* Phillips head screw driver
* Tools for etching and cutting plastic
* Drill

There are 2 USB ports on the combined Max32 and Network Shield, so getting the
cables sorted out can be a bit confusing. The ports are meant to be used as
follows:

* Mini-USB - connect to the serial console for debugging and to upload new
  firmware.
* Micro-USB - the OpenXC data is sent through this port - connect it to your
  computer for testing with the Python script, or to an Android tablet to run
  an OpenXC application.

<div class="alert alert-error">
<strong>A note about power:</strong> In order to power the board via micro-USB,
you have to connect the 5v rails of the chipKIT and network shield. This means
that you absolutely must not plug the mini-USB and micro-USB ports in to
different devices at the same time! This would short 2 different 5v sources
together and likely destroy the chipKIT and network shield.
</div>

The OBD-II cable is safe to plug in at any time, with the vehicle running or
off. The cable only fits one way into the vehicle's port, like a USB cable.
